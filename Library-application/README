##The Library of HashBabel - Homework 2

###Description:

    This project was about implementing a library system, using the CLI.
The implementation is based on the use of hashtables, for which is used the
skeleton from the laboratory. To add books to the library I used the add
function in which I first added the definitions of a book and then the book
itself. The rest of the library system consists of getting a book, removing it
and its definitions.
    The other part is a hashtable for the users of the library. Every user can
borrow, return or lose a book. So in order to take into account each book,
I made a string that keeps the name of the book borrowed by any user.


### Comments on the homework:

*Do you think you could have done a better implementation?
 Maybe I could if I had a lot of free time.

*What did you learn from this homework?
 I think the homework worked perfectly to help me perfect the implementation of
hashtables.
